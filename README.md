# SP404-Beat-Science
Pitch Calculator 
This is my initial readme file presented in plain text. The goal of this project is to create a "beat-science-calculator." The app should be a very simple terminal based script / app. The app should run such that when you initiate the script it "starts." Once the app starts it should stay active until the user exits the app. The script should ask the user for their inital tempo. After validating the response the script should ask the user for the desired pitch shift in semitones (ie -2). The script should then tell the user what they should set the new tempo to in Pro-Tools to achieve this result (limited to three decimal places). Afterward the script should ask the user to press enter to run the script again, or press z to exit. As icing on the cake, it would be fun to create a kind of asche art "splash page" whenever the script is started initially of a drum machine. The coding language should be python.
